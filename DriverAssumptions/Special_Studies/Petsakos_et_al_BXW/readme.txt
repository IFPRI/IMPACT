BXW_data.gdx contains all incidence rates and number of infected fields over time for all countries.
It is the input data used to shock the IMPACT baseline.

Years are denoted by t1,t2,...,t11 instead of the usual 2020,2021,...,2030
This was done to disentangle the actual set of years in IMPACT with the yield shocks, because the yield shock for year t,
are introduced by adjusting the YldInt2 for year t-1. When using actual years, this created some confusion in understanding 
the code

Results_AFR.gdx contains all results generated by IMPACT. Most of them are used in the manuscript
